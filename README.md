  ## Description  
  This homework was creating an application to write and save notes. The front end was already provided and express.js was used to store and retrieve data.

  The exact criteria were as follows:
    ```
    GIVEN a note-taking application
    WHEN I open the Note Taker
    THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
    WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
    THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
    WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
    THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
    WHEN I click on the Save icon
    THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
    WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
    THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
    WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
    THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
    ```
